	<p> I have always had a love of computers. I didn't grow up with a lot of technology. I grew up with one hour a week in computer lab, in school where you could play Oregon Trail. I love that game! I didn't receive my first computer until I graduated high schcool. I had the fun of dealing with dial up internet and AOL. I decided to folow my mothers foot steps and went into the medical field. I recived my B.S. in Radiolgy. Soon after graduating college my grandmother had a stroke. I quit my job to care of her. As she got better it was time to go back to work. Unfortunely I forgot to renew my professional license. I took a job as a domestic viloence advocate. Then I eneded up at the IRS, for more money.</p>

	<p>As time went on my grandparents health began to decline once again. I wanted an opportunity where I could do something I love and have the freedom to care for my grandparents. That's when I found web design and web development. I love creating websites for my clients. Taking the project from the first designs and making their visions a reality. Then taking the design and making it fuctional. Then the launch.</p>
